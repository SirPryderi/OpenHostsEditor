⚠ REQUIRES ROOT ⚠

Free and open source application to edit the /etc/hosts file for Android devices.

Your device must be rooted. Not all devices have the hosts file in the same path, so it might not work on yours. You can submit an issue so that I can investigate.

The application is free, open source, and contains no ad.
